              Hi, Iâ€™m Jayanta. Nice to meet you.

              I started my journey 6 years ago as the Founder and Creative
              Director of Kollab - a streetwear brand. The love for building
              aesthetically pleasing products led me to the digital world. Fast
              forward to today's date, I am a Frontend and Fullstack Engineer,
              who has built functional applications that solved real-world
              problems of a business. I'm currently working on a few independent
              projects, including a component library, an
              ecommerce-backend-as-a-service application. I I'm an extremely
              fast learner and aim at nothing short of mastery, naturally
              curious, and perpetually building my repertoire one design problem
              at a time.
